This project introduces **WeTok**, a powerful discrete visual tokenizer designed to resolve the long-standing conflict between compression efficiency and reconstruction fidelity. WeTok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, surpassing previous leading discrete and continuous tokenizers. <br><br>

## üì∞ News
* **[2025.08.05]**:fire::fire::fire: We release a series of WeTok models, achieving a record-low zero-shot rFID of **0.12** on ImageNet, surpassing top continuous tokenizers like FLUX-VAE and SD-VAE 3.5.
* **[2025.08.05]** We are excited to release **WeTok**, a powerful discrete tokenizer featuring our novel **Grouped Lookup-Free Quantization (GFQ)** and a **generative decoder**. Code and pretrained models are now available!

## üìñ Implementations

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation
- **Dependencies**: 
```
bash env.sh
```

### Evaluation

- **Evaluation on ImageNet 50K Validation Set**

The dataset should be organized as follows:
```
imagenet
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ val/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Run the 256√ó256 resolution evaluation script:
```
bash scripts/evaluation/imagenet_evaluation_256_dist.sh
```

Run the original resolution evaluation script:
```
bash scripts/evaluation/imagenet_evaluation_original_dist.sh
```

- **Evaluation on MS-COCO Val2017**

The dataset should be organized as follows:
```
MSCOCO2017
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ val2017/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Run the evaluation script:
```
bash scripts/evaluation/mscocoval_evaluation_256_dist.sh
```

Run the original resolution evaluation script:
```
bash scripts/evaluation/mscoco_evaluation_original_dist.sh
```


### Inference

Simply test the effect of each model reconstruction:
```
bash scripts/inference/reconstruct_image.sh
```
